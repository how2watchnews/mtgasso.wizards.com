										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Eleven-year-old Saima was excited about getting a sibling in just two months. Yet here, she is being consoled by a relative as she wails, having learned that her eight-month-pregnant mother Farzana just died from dengue in Mugda Medical College Hospital’s ICU yesterday morning.PHOTO: ANISUR RAHMAN Twenty-year-old Mohammad Sakib was admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Sunday as he was experiencing severe weakness a dengue symptom that is considered a &#8220;warning sign&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, as there was not a single bed available, his father had to buy a mat for him to be placed on the floor of the medicine unit, where he is still undergoing treatment. I was diagnosed with typhoid and dengue, both. I am doing a bit better now. But I plan to leave my job and go to my village home once my condition improves, as where I live and work right now in the city – Matuail – lacks anti-mosquito activities,&#8221; said Sakib. Like Sakib, many patients at DMCH are being treated on the floor due to a scarcity of beds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Riaz Uddin, a doctor at the medicine ward, said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t send back patients who are in a critical stage with such warning signs, comorbidity patients, or those in high risk. As we have a scarcity of beds, we are trying to make space on the floor in order to ensure their treatment,&#8221; he said. HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, said immediate hospitalisation is required if a patient experiences severe stomach aches, breathing difficulty, severe weakness, vomiting, and/or bleeding from gums and nose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a patient is not hospitalised within 24 hours [of these symptoms surfacing], they may go into dengue shock syndrome. Zaheda Begum, an aunt of Abir, 15, who has been in DMCH since Saturday, said they also had to get a mat to use as a bed on the floor for him. However, with continuous treatment, Abir is doing well now.&#8221; Morshed Alam, 30, a resident of Cumilla&#8217;s Daudkandi, was admitted to DMCH with dengue on Sunday and was about to get his treatment started after his test reports were available. But as I wasplaced on the floor, my test reports, along with my mobile phone, were all stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, a doctor died of dengue fever at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) in the early hours ofyesterday. Almina Dewan Mishu, 32, was a 39th BCS cadre officer. She had been under treatment at the hospital&#8217;s ICU since August 1. Earlier, she was at a private hospital after being diagnosed with dengue on July 26, and then was transferred to DMCH as her condition deteriorated. She was declared dead around 5:30am, DMCH Director Brig Gen Md Nazmul Haque told The Daily Star.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was buried at her ancestral graveyard in Narayanganj&#8217;s Kanchan municipality. The Directorate General of Health Services expressed deep condolences at the death. According to the DGHS, with the deaths of Almina and 12 others yesterday, the number of dengue fatalities rose to 340, of which 194 are female and 146 are male. Eleven of the deaths occurred in Dhaka city. Meanwhile, 2,742 dengue patients were hospitalised across the country in the last 24 hours till yesterday morning, bringing the total number of cases to 72,225.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">An upazila health complex, responsible for providing medical care to at least five lakh people in and around the upazila, has been unable to perform X-rays for the past 28 years due to the lack of a technician. The clamour for a technician from patients and hospital officials seem to have been falling on deaf ears for a long time. Kulaura Upazila Health Complex, established in 1972, currently has three X-ray machines, worth around Tk 70 lakhs in total, allocated by the government at different times. However, none of them are in operation, said Upazila Health and Family Planning Officer Ferdous Akhter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the health complex sources, former finance minister M Saifur Rahman inaugurated the first X-ray machine worth Tk 14 lakh in 1995. Later, in 2006, another X-ray machine worth TK 35 lakhs was allocated. Recently, a digital X-ray machine worth Tk 23,19,000 was allocated just three months ago. However, the government failed to appoint a technician for the hospital in all these years. The X-ray room has been turned into a storeroom. The first two machines have become non-functional due to lack of use, the newest one will also stop working if not used, said hospital officials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;After getting the new X-ray machine, I have sent several letters to the higher authorities to appoint technicians,&#8221; said Ferdous Akhter. Patients from the upazila and surrounding remote areas rely on the hospital for healthcare. An average of 500-600 outpatients and 100-150 emergency patients are treated daily at the hospital. Around 50 of these patients require X-rays on average, said hospital sources. Such patients, including emergency ones, are sent to get X-rays done from private hospitals in the area. They also have to pay extra for the X-rays as private hospitals charge more than government ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I was recently injured in a road accident. But, since there is no X-ray service at the hospital, I paid Tk 1,000 to a diagnostic centre and showed the report to the doctor at the upazila health complex. We have to deal with the hassle due to the lack of a single technician,&#8221; said Tarek Hasan, a resident of Pabai village in Hajipur union of Kulaura, who came to the hospital for a follow-up. When asked, Moulvibazar District Civil Surgeon Chowdhury Jalal Uddin Murshed said he knew about the absence of a technician. He said he conveyed the matter to the central authorities several times. &#8220;Technicians are recruited centrally from the Directorate General of Health Services. Central authorities and the civil surgeon&#8217;s office are working to solve the issue,&#8221; he said. Without elaborating, he added that authorities will also fix the X-ray room soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Diet and exercise are key to optimal health. The risk of many chronic illnesses increases with age. Here are some tips to lose weight after 40: Age matters: If you are over 40, changes in your activity level, eating habits, hormones, and how your body stores fat can play roles. But a few simple steps may help you slim down. Eat your fruits and veggies: Fill half your plate with them at every meal. Produce tends to have more nutrients and less fat and calories than meat, dairy products, or grains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don&#8217;t skip breakfast:</strong> Experts recommend a healthy morning meal like oatmeal or whole-wheat toast with fruit. It can help curb that mid-morning hunger that leads you to grab something unhealthy on the go or overeat at lunch. Small meals or snacks every few hours can keep your appetite in check all day long. Eat less at night: If you get most of your daily calories at lunch (before 3 p.m.), you might lose more weight than if you have a big meal later. Cook healthy meals: Instead of frying food or cooking it in butter or lots of oil, try grilling, baking, or broiling. Also, skip foods that are fried or that come in creamy sauces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Donot make a second trip:</strong> You tend to be less active as you get older, and you may need a few hundred calories less than you used to. To lose weight, you may need to cut your calories back even more. Smaller portions and tracking your calories with a food diary or an app can help you eat less. Pay attention: When you are busy, you are more likely to overeat and be hungry again soon if you do not focus on your food. Lay off the soda: If you drink sugar-sweetened beverages, switch to water or another zero-calorie beverage. Sweet drinks raise your risk for diabetes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Avoid alcohol:</strong> A glass of beer or wine is about 150 calories, which can add up if you drink often. Also, alcohol can make you hungry, so you may eat more while you drink. Make time for exercise: Every week at least 2.5 hours of moderate physical activity (like brisk walking or light yard work) can make you stay healthy. Build muscle: Muscle burns more calories than fat; this can slow down your metabolism and make it harder to shake those stubborn pounds. Strength training at least twice a week can help you keep those muscles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Relax:</strong> Stress can make you more likely to binge on unhealthy food, making it harder for your body to break down fat. Try yoga, deep breathing, meditation, going for a walk, or reading a good book</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Get good sleep:</strong> People who do not get good-quality sleep are more likely to gain weight. If you skimp on sleep because you are busy or stressed, try to change your habits and settle into a routine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Have your thyroid checked:</strong> If you eat healthily and exercise regularly and still cannot lose weight, your thyroid might not be working as it should. This happens in about 5% of people, and it&#8217;s most common in women and people over 60. In addition to weight gain, it can also cause fatigue, joint or muscle pain, and depression. So, get it checked if you think it might be an issue. Get support: You might enter a weight-loss contest at work, join a group on social media, or ask a friend to go for early-morning walks or classes at the gym. Other people who share your goals can help keep you accountable and cheer you on as you make progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Multi-drug resistance in bacteria has increased by 14 percent over the last seven years, and most of them are getting even more resistant to certain antibiotics, said a national AMR (antimicrobial resistance) surveillance report. The group of MDR bacteria is getting bigger due to the increasing resistance, causing serious public health concerns, it added. MDR refers to a bacterium that becomes resistant to at least one drug from three or more groups of antibiotics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As per the report, MDR resistance, which was at 71 percent in 2017, had risen to 82 percent by June this year. Over time, most bacteria are developing increasing resistance to antibiotics, particularly the frequently used ones. Prof Zakir Hossain Habib, chief scientific officer of IEDCR and member secretary of AMR Surveillance Sectoral Working Group (Human Health), presented the findings of the National AMR Surveillance 2023 during a programme yesterday at IEDCR, marking World AMR Awareness Week. While the report notes a significant difference in bacteria resistance between outpatient departments and indoors, the microorganisms isolated from ICUs show the least effectiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, K pneumoniae, and Staph aureus are among the bacteria that are highly antibiotic-resistant. The report blamed repeated and excessive use of medicine for this situation. Ceftriaxone and Cefixime are listed as most frequently used antibiotics that are experiencing a decrease in effectiveness, and bacterial resistance against both of them is on the rise, said the report. Md Jahangir Alam, secretary of health services division at the health ministry, said, &#8220;Doctors need to be more aware and reduce antibiotic usage to promote a healthy life.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He stressing the need for increased research and laboratory facilities. Prof Abul Bashar Mohammad Khurshid Alam, director general of DGHS, urged everyone to adhere to infection prevention practises. &#8220;Solely relying on antibiotic use would not prevent the rapid increase of AMR. A collective effort is required for that,&#8221; he said. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine, highlighted the need to refrain from prescribing antibiotics without proper tests. She urged the authorities, including the Drug Administration, to take measures to curb the aggressive marketing tactics employed by pharmaceutical companies that encourage the indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Working long hours is killing hundreds of thousands of people a year in a worsening trend that may accelerate further due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization said on Monday. In the first global study of the loss of life associated with longer working hours, the paper in the journal Environment International showed that 745,000 people died from stroke and heart disease associated with long working hours in 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was an increase of nearly 30 percent from 2000. Working 55 hours or more per week is a serious health hazard,&#8221; said Maria Neira, director of the WHO&#8217;s Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. What we want to do with this information is promote more action, more protection of workers,&#8221; she said. The joint study, produced by the WHO and the International Labour Organization, showed that most victims (72 percent) were men and were middle-aged or older. Often, the deaths occurred much later in life, sometimes decades later, than the shifts worked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also showed that people living in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region &#8212; a WHO-defined region which includes China, Japan and Australia &#8212; were the most affected. Overall, the study &#8211; drawing on data from 194 countries &#8211; said that working 55 hours or more a week is associated with a 35 percent higher risk of stroke and a 17 percent higher risk of dying from ischemic heart disease compared with a 35-40 hour working week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The study covered the period 2000-2016, and so did not include the Covid-19 pandemic, but WHO officials said the surge in remote working and the global economic slowdown resulting from the coronavirus emergency may have increased the risks. The pandemic is accelerating developments that could feed the trend towards increased working time,&#8221; the WHO said, estimating that at least 9 percent of people work long hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WHO staff, including its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, say they have been working long hours during the pandemic and Neira said the UN agency would seek to improve its policy in light of the study. Capping hours would be beneficial for employers since that has been shown to increase worker productivity, WHO technical officer Frank Pega said. It&#8217;s really a smart choice not to increase long working hours in an economic crisis.&#8221;</p>
