The risk of many chronic illnesses increases with age. Here are some tips to lose weight after 40: Age matters: If you are over 40, changes in your activity level, eating habits, hormones, and how your body stores fat can play roles. But a few simple steps may help you slim down. Eat your fruits and veggies: Fill half your plate with them at every meal. Produce tends to have more nutrients and less fat and calories than meat, dairy products, or grains.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t skip breakfast:<\/strong> Experts recommend a healthy morning meal like oatmeal or whole-wheat toast with fruit. It can help curb that mid-morning hunger that leads you to grab something unhealthy on the go or overeat at lunch. Small meals or snacks every few hours can keep your appetite in check all day long. Eat less at night: If you get most of your daily calories at lunch (before 3 p.m.), you might lose more weight than if you have a big meal later. Cook healthy meals: Instead of frying food or cooking it in butter or lots of oil, try grilling, baking, or broiling. Also, skip foods that are fried or that come in creamy sauces.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Donot make a second trip:<\/strong> You tend to be less active as you get older, and you may need a few hundred calories less than you used to. To lose weight, you may need to cut your calories back even more. Smaller portions and tracking your calories with a food diary or an app can help you eat less. Pay attention: When you are busy, you are more likely to overeat and be hungry again soon if you do not focus on your food. Lay off the soda: If you drink sugar-sweetened beverages, switch to water or another zero-calorie beverage. Sweet drinks raise your risk for diabetes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Avoid alcohol:<\/strong> A glass of beer or wine is about 150 calories, which can add up if you drink often. Also, alcohol can make you hungry, so you may eat more while you drink. Make time for exercise: Every week at least 2.5 hours of moderate physical activity (like brisk walking or light yard work) can make you stay healthy. Build muscle: Muscle burns more calories than fat; this can slow down your metabolism and make it harder to shake those stubborn pounds. Strength training at least twice a week can help you keep those muscles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Relax:<\/strong> Stress can make you more likely to binge on unhealthy food, making it harder for your body to break down fat. Try yoga, deep breathing, meditation, going for a walk, or reading a good book<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Get good sleep:<\/strong> People who do not get good-quality sleep are more likely to gain weight. If you skimp on sleep because you are busy or stressed, try to change your habits and settle into a routine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Have your thyroid checked:<\/strong> If you eat healthily and exercise regularly and still cannot lose weight, your thyroid might not be working as it should. This happens in about 5% of people, and it&#8217;s most common in women and people over 60. In addition to weight gain, it can also cause fatigue, joint or muscle pain, and depression. So, get it checked if you think it might be an issue. Get support: You might enter a weight-loss contest at work, join a group on social media, or ask a friend to go for early-morning walks or classes at the gym. Other people who share your goals can help keep you accountable and cheer you on as you make progress.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Diet and exercise are key to optimal health.
